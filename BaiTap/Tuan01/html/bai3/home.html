        Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success! 
        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. 
        I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.

        Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
